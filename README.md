# Umblazor 

This a POC of how to run Umbraco but having the front-end rendered by Blazor and Razor components instead of the traditional MVC views.

In the Index.razor component there is a wildcard route, a page content loader (for the current slug URL) and a very simple selection of wich "page component" the Model should be passed to.
